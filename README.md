This project implements the frontend for Decentralized Machine Learning (DML).

## Implementation notes

This project is implemented using Typescript, React, Redux-Saga and Bootstrap.
The initial boilerplate was generated using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with Typescript tooling
as described in [TypeScript React Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter).
The boilerplate was manually extended to include:
- redux-saga,
- react-router-dom,
- react-error-overlay,
- reactstrap (Bootstrap 4),
- react-fontawesome.

Testing is implemented using Jest and Enzyme.

Deployment is managed using ???TODO: choose a deployment tool???.
